== DESCRIPTION ==

"ioflow" is aiming to make life of electronic artists easier by making 
rapid-prototyping with new hardware interfaces (monome, wii-mote, 
arduino-based, ...) available for everyone.

It's platform independent & GPL in order to keep it barrier-free.



== HISTORY ==

Back in October 2007, ^Rooker had an idea for his master thesis, called:
        "Semantic Abstraction Layer for Hardware Interfaces 
         with Focus on Electronic Music"

Unfortunately, due to lack of time, the ideas were just lying around in an 
online forum [1].


In September 2008, the project was revived by members of the monome community 
(initially xndr & tehn) due to a similar idea, called:
        "multifunctional protocol router for open hardware" [2][3]


Forces were joined, which led to the development of "ioflow".
